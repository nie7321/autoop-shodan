AUTOOP:SHODAN SOURCECODE RELEASE
FEB 2004


Ah, remember this? Shodan was the second MOD we ran on GP2 back in the old school days.

This is the code as its been sat on the server since the last build, I believe it has all the GP2
specific stuff in it, I compiled it once and it build without any warnings or errors.

As for the resources for this mod.. tbh I have no clue where to get them ask
around on gpaspforums.girlpower.dhs.org, I'm sure someone will have a copy of them.

In the root of the zip file are some demo config files, also the sourcecode to a skeleton plugin
is included.

Enjoy,

- Rob
